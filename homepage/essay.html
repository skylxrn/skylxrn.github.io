            <h1>My Essay</h1>
            <p>
                Upon opening the doors to the sound of endless chattering, I look around, in search of my cousins among the countless other Asians, sitting on identical chairs, with identical tables. The only difference is that my cousins are from New Jersey, as they give off a different aura than the rest. After about 10 seconds, I finally spot them and start shamelessly walking over as if I hadn’t done anything wrong. I was late; I’m always late. It’s become a part of my daily routine to get anywhere I have to go on the dot. But once I sit down, my mind clears from all the rushing and effort I tirelessly put in to get here. I start to zone in on the present rather than the past, and the cycle repeats itself every month. This is Chinatown.
            </p>
            <p>
              Chinatown is the place where parks are scattered down every other street. It's the place where buildings display the small shops or takeout joints on the bottom and the old, rusty brick apartments on the top. It's the place where my parents grew up after immigrating from Hong Kong. Where they changed from a completely average household to a cockroach-infested apartment with no heating or shower. My dad always speaks of how Chinatown now is like heaven compared to back then. With the iconic phrase “back in my day,” he tells my sister and me about the gangs who would try to recruit children whenever they had the chance. We don’t know the fear of having to desert the premises once we spotted their iconic uniforms or when someone shouted, “They’re coming!” Walking around Chinatown without your parents wasn't safe, since children could be forced into recruitment at any time. If they tried to refuse, they could be assaulted and possibly killed. Or at least that’s what my dad says.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, those gang-designated areas in Pell Street became the designated area for run-down barber shops where I can get a haircut for 12 dollars. Today, there is no chicken in the Chinatown arcade as the reigning champion who would completely demolish everyone in Tic-Tac-Toe. And today, I  dislike all the familiarness of Chinatown, and would rather be doing something else, somewhere else. Eventually, after going to Chinatown almost every day, I grew tired of the salty dim sum and oily Chinese takeout. I became sick of all the rat-infested trash bags at night and the cramped, overfilled Chinatown food markets. All the time I spend in Chinatown could be spent doing something more productive or more enjoyable rather than walking around aimlessly shopping with my parents.
            </p>
            <p>
              But despite my displeasure with Chinatown, I grew up here, and I wouldn’t be the same person without it. This area has shaped the way of life for many people who may have lived in Chinatown their entire lives. My childhood in NYC Chinatown has shaped my personality, my interests, and my way of thinking. For my parents, without the gangs and the impoverished lifestyle, they could have been completely different people with completely different personalities. The old grandmas doing yoga at 7 in the morning, the teenagers getting boba after school every other week, or the jumbled-up, crowded sidewalks full of different kinds of people—it's all the same old Chinatown.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter if it's the past or the present, Chinatown will always be full of the same people, the same buildings, and the same atmosphere. There will always be poverty-stricken immigrants who will struggle, endure, and spare no effort for their children, with each passing generation working hard to ensure that their children live better lives than they did. There will always be the single-unit, family-owned restaurants that people go to for their favorite rice noodles or congee. And there will always be a general atmosphere of rowdiness, where everyone is occupied with their objectives on the same street.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the future, things might change as the world slowly becomes more and more modernized. The old brick buildings I’m used to seeing may be replaced with the new, clean quartz or metal used in the futuristic movies. Or maybe I’m getting ahead of myself and it will always be the same old same old. Whether things change or not, the essence of Chinese culture within this place will always stay the same. This is Chinatown, and it will always be Chinatown.
